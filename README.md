# ORCA-Basis-Sets

This example is for getting the 6-31G* basis set on a bromine atom in ORCA. The keyword is not available for these atoms. 

There will be a series of files:
  1) Typical input for a B3LYP 6-31G* energy calculation
  2) Error if recieved from typical input
  3) 6-31G* basis set from BSE (https://www.basissetexchange.org/)
  4) Corrected basis set format that is ORCA compatible
  5) Corrected input file
